# hurwitzLab

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## What's here?

* Colors
* Several pre-defined palettes
* Scaling functions for implementation in `ggplot2`

## Installation

You can install hurwitzLab with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("hurwitzlab/hurwitzLab")
```

However, I would suggest installing with 

``` r
devtools::install_github("hurwitzlab/hurwitzLab", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

This will build and make the vignettes available to you, which are very helpful for learning how to use this package. The drawback is that you may need to install other packages to make it work.

You can then access the vignettes with

``` r
vignette("hurwitzLab")
```

If the package is installed without the `build_vignettes = TRUE` option, the vignette can be built with 

``` r
devtools::build_vignettes("hurwitzLab")
```
